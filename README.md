[Images](/BlocksExperimentFINAL/images) are taken from the [ShapeStacks dataset](https://ogroth.github.io/shapestacks/), *"a simulation-based dataset featuring 20,000 stack configurations composed of a variety of elementary geometric primitives richly annotated regarding semantics and structural stability"* (Groth et al., [2018](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Oliver_Groth_ShapeStacks_Learning_Vision-Based_ECCV_2018_paper.html)).

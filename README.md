[This](/FINALwithImageCombos.html) is sample code for an online psychophysics experiment that explores how motivation biases intuitive physical judgements.

[Images](/BlocksExperimentFINAL/images) are taken from the [ShapeStacks dataset](https://ogroth.github.io/shapestacks/), *"a simulation-based dataset featuring 20,000 stack configurations composed of a variety of elementary geometric primitives richly annotated regarding semantics and structural stability"* (Groth et al., [2018](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Oliver_Groth_ShapeStacks_Learning_Vision-Based_ECCV_2018_paper.html)).

You can demo the task [here](https://vawfux9apy.cognition.run/). The “neutral” condition (first part of the task) is pretty simple. The two other conditions (“cooperation” and “competition”) are more complicated, and involve betting with a virtual “teammate” or “opponent”.

**Note:* When the demo asks for a “Prolific ID”, just type any random sequence of numbers or letters into the space provided, and you will be allowed to continue to the experiment.*
